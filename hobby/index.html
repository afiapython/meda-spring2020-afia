 <h1>READING IS MY BEST HOBBY</h1>
 <p>Hi,My name is Afia.Today I would like to tell you about my reading hobby.
    Reading is an incredibly inexpensive hobby that provides so many benefits.
    books make my mind sharp. It is a known fact that books improve our brain muscles.
    They make us think better and improve our decision making abilities.</p>

<p>Regular reading has many advantages, reading is a good hobby that can increase
    your overall knowledge level and help you improve various skills.
    Of course, it will also just allow you to have fun and escape the everyday life!
    Reading different technical books, magazines and other novels greatly improves your knowledge.
    Simply reading a newspaper every day is in itself a great hobby to have. It gives you details
    of the current affairs and all the important activities in the world.</p>
<p>When a person reads a book, his mind is completely involved in the activity of reading.
    He has to understand the text, interpret the meaning and analyse the situation to make a
    mental image of the scenario in the written text. All this requires immense mental activity
    making reading one of the most involving hobbies adopted by man. The outcome of the habit of
    reading is improved concentration and focus. You are forced to concentrate on the book and
    prepare an image in your mind. Hence no diversions or thoughts occupy your mind when you are
    reading. As you never digress from the book, you develop your concentration and improve your
    focus through reading. When you read for about an hour daily, you will have much better
    concentration and focus than all those who do not read anything. This will help you in all
    the activities that you perform improving your productivity considerably.</p>

    <h2>You Can Read Anywhere and Anytime</h2>
    <p>Reading is a good hobby that everyone can do. All you need to read is a book
       that you actually want to read. You can read your book almost everywhere,
       of course, I would not advise you to read while driving your car or your bike.
       Some of the most common places where people read are in public places such as coffee shops
       and libraries, relaxed on the couch or in bed, on the bus or train while going to work.</p>
            

    <h2>It does Not Cost a Lot of Money</h2>
    <p>Reading definitely does not need to cost a lot of money. You can find reasonably priced books
    online in all of the very well-known online bookstores. You can also reduce the average cost
    of your books if you mainly buy paperbacks, which are considerably cheaper than hardcovers.
    Another way to save money and spend less on reading is by buying books in second-hand
    bookstores.Because reading makes you feel relaxed and you often read in quiet places where you like
    spending time, reading will reduce your overall stress level.</p>

    <h2>Reading Increases Your Tolerance</h2>
    <p>When you read a lot of books, you will learn about people in different situations, with different
       opinions, beliefs, and lifestyles. This will not necessarily mean that you will agree with everything
       that you read or learn about. But you will be able to better understand the situations of others and 
       show more empathy. You will learn not to judge without understanding or knowing the story behind certain 
       behaviors and opinions. In this way, reading can and will increase your tolerance in daily life.</p>

    <h2>Tips to adopt reading as a hobby</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>You must be prepared to spend at least 2 hours daily for your hobby.</li>

    <h3>Reading Makes You Sleep Better</h3>
    <p>Recent sleep studies show that you will more easily fall asleep after reading a good book.
    You will also experience a deeper sleep and wake up feeling more energized. In addition,
    you will feel more satisfied as you have used your time productively.
    At least you did not spend hours checking Facebook or Twitter.</p>
