Step A: ABOUT ME PAGE:
   As a former COMPUTER student, I have gained a working knowledge of Python, JavaScript, Java. I am a Full Time Coding Learner living in  Bay Area. 
I am passionate about both the user experience and site architecture that follow fundamentals of clean/well-separated code. 
I believe in the model of: less code is more and constantly seeking opportunities to learn, and improve coding skills.

I have Masters in Software Engineering from India.With a background in Computers ,I am looking to use the skills and experiences I have gained to work 
as a full time developer, with the ability to learn self-efficiently.

In my spare time, when I am not coding, I like to enjoy the activities being outdoors.
